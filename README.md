# ColoursCSS - Whats is?

```Colours.css``` is a mini CSS framework geared specifically towards color. With a wide color palette, colours.css makes it easy to develop your front end with easy-to-read, ready-made classes.

# How to use?

The use of ```ColoursCSS``` is greatly simplified. Just add the colours.css file to the CSS folder in your project, and add the following line between ```<head></head>``` tags of your code.

```html
<head>
	<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/colours.css"/>
</head>
```

After adding the file, you can use the colors you want, just add the class corresponding to each color in the elements you want to customize, for example ```class="red light-2"```.
Here's how simple it is to change the background color of a div:

```html
	<div class="red light-2">Div com fundo vermelho</div>
```

In addition to changing the background color of an element, with the ```Colours.css``` you can also change the color of the font. Just add the ```text-``` prefix in the class name, which looks like this: ```class="text-red light-2"```.

```html
	<h2 class="text-red light-2">Your text goes here.<h2>
```
